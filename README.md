# Pull Request in Visual Studio

## Preconditions

GitHub Visual Studio Extension installed. Here is a quick [Guide](https://github.com/github/VisualStudio/blob/master/docs/getting-started/installing-github-for-visual-studio.md) on how to install the Extension.

The following [Tutorial](https://github.blog/2018-03-23-require-multiple-reviewers/#:~:text=To%20require%20multiple%20reviewers%20for,pull%20request%20to%20that%20branch.) will show how to activate brach protection, so that the pull request can only be merged when a certain number of reviewers gave their approval for the pull request.
